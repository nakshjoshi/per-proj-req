To create a Discord board, the board listens to a mystery and replies. First, create your own server on Discord for club and communities. We give it a name. In normal situations, General Channel is sufficient to work with the server. Then we open User Settings, go to Advanced, and turn on the Developer Mode for that server. Then we search, go to the Discord Developer Portal. Inside Discord Developer Portal, inside Bar, we go to Application, create a new application, name it. Inside the application, we go to Bot, name the bot, give the bot all the admin permissions. Now we will work on adding the bot to the Discord server and grant permission. Inside Developer Console, we go to OAuth, then URL Generator. We select the bot and the admin option, copy and paste the URL in the browser, select the server, and join. To make the user interact with the bot, we use the Discord.js library and implement it in Node.js. We first go to the VS Code or any IDE, do npm install on Discord.js. Inside the index file, we basically write code to get recent tokens, import Discord, set up Discord gateway intent, turn on message content intent, and then we write the normal Express app following the Discord documentation.
