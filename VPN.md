So, basically, the flow is like, there is a client and user which is connected to its internet service provider. The internet service provider has access to services like Google. What we do by keeping a VPN in between is, we channelize all the requests made by client through VPN. So, client will make a request to VPN, the VPN client will encrypt and root data to its remote server. So, there is an extra hop, so speed may get lessened. From the VPN client, we go to the internet service provider of the region, wherever the client is. The internet service provider will have the IP address, it will decrypt the proxy for me and send it to services like Google or other things. So, now, how to make an up and running hour VPN on Amazon EC2 machine.So to do this what we do is we go to AWS, select a different region because that's why making a VPN would give benefit to us. So we go with like Virginia or maybe North America. We create a new instance of the AWS EC2. We go to OpenVPN and then read some documentations. We search for an Amazon machine image of OpenVPN. We will not select the app Ubuntu now, but we will use the OpenVPN Amazon machine image. Select the machine configuration as T2Large, then launch the instance. Connect to the terminal to the AWS machine, our local terminal. Use git bash, open the SSH client and follow the instructions provided on the OpenVPN website, like installing images and doing the other things.
