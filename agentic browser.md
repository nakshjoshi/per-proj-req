Agentic Browser Use means letting an AI agent (like ChatGPT, Gemini, Ollama or an autonomous assistant) use a web browser like a we do — to search, click, read, and act on real websites in real-time to complete a task.

It is basically and AI Agent and needs tool and a Brain(LLM) to work

why we need agentic browser today:
- Real-time search: 	LLMs are trained on data up to a certain date. They can’t give real-time info like current news or stock prices.\
- Automate tasks:	Agents can book a ticket, fill forms, or extract info from PDFs or pages.
- May Be Web Scrappers or Crawlers
- Instead of loading huge documents into the prompt, the agent can browse and pull only what's needed.

Tool Stack Behind the Scenes

Playwright / Puppeteer is for Scripted headless browsing
LangChain gives Agents ie Planning + Tool Use
Retriever Pulls text from websites
OpenAI GPT/Gemini is to be used for Decision making, tool calling

###Limitations of Agentic Browser
- May not handle dynamic JavaScript-heavy websites well.

- A bit slower than normal responses (due to loading).

- Can’t log into sites or interact with CAPTCHAs (for now).

- Needs a good prompt to guide it to the right info.
