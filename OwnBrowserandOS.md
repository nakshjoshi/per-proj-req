So what we do is, this is a local machine and we have a docker image with a UI browser and we need to do the AWS deployment for it and destroy it after usage also to avoid billing. So the procedure is, and here we go to AWS then select EC2, set its configuration names, what type of things we want to use like the T2-Large or T2-Extra-Large CPU and RAM models, make it up and running, then use KASM, KASM workspaces, get the docker image of Vivaldi browser from it and follow the steps and documentation on the KASM KASM and basically the Amazon AWS to first acquire the terminal of the running machine on cloud and then patch in our docker image there and install it to make it up and running. We may also use speedtest to see the speed of the cloud-based computer we have hosted there to just get an idea of the in and out rates of data.
